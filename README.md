# TinyTimer
Documentation for a Parachute Timer based on the Attiny85 Microcontroller

## Hardware

Eagle Files for etching a PCB to house the ATTiny. This will NOT include a list of parts to build the Timer yourself.

## Software

Arduino IDE Source Code to program the ATTiny. 
Please Note that you will need an Arduino or ISP to program the ATTiny. The EAGLE Files for a Demo Programminsg Shield are in the Hardware Folder.
 ## Disclaimer
 
 The Idea and the First Version of the Tiny Timer was made by Achim Oelkers (AchimO) on https://www.raketenmodellbau.org/forum?action=viewthread&threadid=801925&page=1 
 A friend and me only decided to optimize the Code for Usability and to provide Eagle files and schematics to make the recreation of this Timer as easy as possible.
