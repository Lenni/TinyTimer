Arduino IDE Source Code to program the ATTiny. 
Please Note that you will need an Arduino or ISP to program the ATTiny. The EAGLE Files for a Demo Programminsg Shield are in the Hardware Folder.
 ## Disclaimer
 
 The Idea and the First Version of the Tiny Timer was made by Achim Oelkers (AchimO) on http://raketenmodellbau.org 
 A friend an me only decided to optimize ther Code for Usability and to provide Eagle files and schematics to make the recreation of this Timer as easy as possible.
