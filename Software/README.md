# TinyTimer
Documentation for a Parachute Timer based on the Attiny85 Microcontroller

## Software

Arduino IDE Source Code to program the ATTiny. 
Please Note that you will need an Arduino or ISP to program the ATTiny. The EAGLE Files for a Demo Programming Shield are in the Hardware Folder.

Before Uploading the Sketch you have to install the Software Servo Library in the Arduino IDE, as well as adding this (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json) URL 
as an additional Board Support URL.

After that you have to choose the Programmer "Arduino as ISP" in the Arduino IDE and upload the source code to the ATTiny in the Programming Shield.


# Disclaimer
 
 The Idea and the First Version of the Tiny Timer was made by Achim Oelkers (AchimO) on http://raketenmodellbau.org 
 A friend an me only decided to optimize ther Code for Usability and to provide Eagle files and schematics to make the recreation of this Timer as easy as possible.
