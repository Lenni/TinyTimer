# TinyTimer
Documentation for a Parachute Timer based on the Attiny85 Microcontroller

## Hardware

Eagle Files for etching a PCB to house the ATTiny. This will NOT include a list of parts to build the Timer yourself.

The power supply for the Board can be any Power Source with a Voltage ranging from 3.7V to 5V. We used a small 100mAh Lithium-Polymer Battery to Power the Circuit and the Servo.

# Disclaimer
 
 The Idea and the First Version of the Tiny Timer was made by Achim Oelkers (AchimO) on http://raketenmodellbau.org 
 A friend an me only decided to optimize ther Code for Usability and to provide Eagle files and schematics to make the recreation of this Timer as easy as possible.
